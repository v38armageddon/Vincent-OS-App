// pch.h: This is a precompiled header file.
// The files listed below are compiled only once, which improves the performance of future builds.
// This also affects the performance of IntelliSense, including code completion and many code navigation features.
// However, all files listed here are recompiled if any of them are updated between builds.
// Do not add frequently updated files here, as this cancels out the performance gains.
